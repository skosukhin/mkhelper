# A rule for targets that are unknown to this makefile. The dependency on a

# even if the requested target already exists. The fact that the rule is
# terminal (i.e. declared with double colon) allows for building targets that
# are normally not matched by "match-anything" pattern rules (e.g. generated
# source files):
